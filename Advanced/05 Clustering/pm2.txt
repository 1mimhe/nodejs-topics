This process manager contains a load balancer and
can automatically create as many worker processes as CPUs on your machine.
It also allows you to monitor the processes and can spawn a new worker process automatically if one dies.

$ pm2 start index.js -i 0
The -i option accepts the number of worker processes you want pm2 to create.
If you pass the argument 0, pm2 will automatically create as many worker processes as there are CPUs on your machine.

$ pm2 logs
$ pm2 ls
$ pm2 delete index.js
