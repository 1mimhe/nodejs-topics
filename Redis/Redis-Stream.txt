1. Add stream events with a system generate id which combines a current timestramp + sequence number (ex. 1720578868-0)

XADD [stream-name] * [key] [value] [key] [value]
XADD my-stream * temperature 60 node_name node1

2. Query a list of events between time frame (ascending order old > new)
XRANGE [stream-name] [start-time-ms] [end-time-ms]
XRANGE my-stream 1720580927360 1720580927370

3. Query a list of events between time frame (descending order new > old)
XREVRANGE [stream-name] [start-time-ms] [end-time-ms]

4. Use - + to replace [start-time-ms] [end-time-ms] to query for all times
XRANGE [COUNT 1] my-stream - +

5. Get or subscribe to events
XREAD COUNT [num] BLOCK [ms] STREAMS [stream-name] [ms]
XREAD COUNT 1 BLOCK 50000 STREAMS my-stream 1720581089061

6. Trim old stream events
XTRIM [stream-name] MAXLEN [max length]
XTRIM my-stream MAXLEN 3
